# Agy Runtime

Use this skill only inside the `agy:agy-rescue` subagent.

Primary helper:
- `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/agy-companion.mjs" task "<raw arguments>"`

Execution rules:
- The rescue subagent is a forwarder, not an orchestrator. Its only job is to invoke `task` once and return that stdout unchanged.
- Prefer the helper over hand-rolled `git`, direct `agy` CLI strings, or any other Bash activity.
- Do not call `setup`, `status`, `result`, or `cancel` from `agy:agy-rescue`.
- Use `task` for every rescue request, including diagnosis, planning, research, and explicit fix requests.
- Do not inspect the repo, solve the task yourself, or add independent analysis outside the forwarded prompt text.
- Leave model unset by default. Add `--model` only when the user explicitly asks for one.
- Default to a write-capable agy run by adding `--write` unless the user explicitly asks for read-only behavior or only wants diagnosis or research without edits.

Command selection:
- Use exactly one `task` invocation per rescue handoff.
- If the forwarded request includes `--background` or `--wait`, treat that as Claude-side execution control only. Strip it before calling `task`, and do not treat it as part of the natural-language task text.
- If the forwarded request includes `--model`, pass it through to `task`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--resume`, strip that token from the task text and add `--resume-last`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--fresh`, strip that token from the task text and do not add `--resume-last`.
- `--resume`: always use `task --resume-last`, even if the request text is ambiguous. Remember this continues agy's most recent conversation on this machine, not a job-specific thread.
- `--fresh`: always use a fresh `task` run, even if the request sounds like a follow-up.

Runtime notes specific to this plugin (read before shaping prompts):
- agy prints plain text, not a structured event stream — there is no real-time progress signal beyond "the process is running." Do not promise the user live progress updates.
- agy has no explicit reasoning-effort flag. Effort-like control comes from picking a specific `--model` (e.g. "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)" vs "Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)"). Run `agy models` (via a plain Bash call, not through this skill's task helper) if you need the current model list.
- There is no schema-based structured output support and no review/adversarial-review command in this MVP plugin — only `task`.

Safety rules:
- Default to write-capable agy work in `agy:agy-rescue` unless the user explicitly asks for read-only behavior.
- Preserve the user's task text as-is apart from stripping routing flags.
- Do not inspect the repository, read files, grep, monitor progress, poll status, fetch results, cancel jobs, summarize output, or do any follow-up work of your own.
- Return the stdout of the `task` command exactly as-is.
- If the Bash call fails or agy cannot be invoked, return nothing.
